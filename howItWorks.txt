If you have multiple C++ files in the same directory and you compile them using the g++ command, 
the default name of the compiled program will be a.exe. If you want to specify a different name 
for the compiled program, you can use the -o option followed by the name you want to use. 
For example, if you want to compile a file named main.cpp and name the compiled program myprogram.exe, 
you would type: g++ main.cpp -o myprogram.exe.


To run a C++ file on Git Bash, you can follow these steps:

    1.Open Git Bash.
    2.Navigate to the directory where your C++ file is located using the cd command.
    3.Compile your C++ file using the g++ command followed by the name of your C++ file. For example, if your file is named main.cpp, you would type g++ main.cpp.
    4.Run your compiled program by typing ./a.exe.
The ./a.exe command is used to run the compiled program. The ./ tells Git Bash to look in the current 
directory for the file named a.exe. The a.exe is the default name given to the compiled program by the g++ command.
